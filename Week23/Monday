Started a new week. Went over this past assesement.

Revisited Polymorphism

Started going over what our project will entail. Will use air bnb as base. Maybe a rental platform for something besides homes. SOmething more unique. Maybe musical instruments? Or studios? We will only be wroking on the backend of it. Express, sequilizing for example, not sure exactly what else yet. There is a link to the Part-Time Mod 4 Portfolio Project Assessment: Road Map
