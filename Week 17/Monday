Started week 17
Started on Browser Basics
Went over Inspector, console, sources, network and application. (See class notes file for more info on each)
Reviewed the assesment.
REalized my error with urls was forgetting the :
for ex. I used /artists/artistID instead of /artists/:artistsId
created new folder Browser basics to start demo on this weeks topics

Went over adding scripts in an index file and sourcing them depending on location. (See bowser basics folder for examples)
When we inspect console we can see all the scripts in order we list them
the sample.js files we use function as utility files. that should be correctly names to identify whats in them

Document Tree

DOM represents the structure of a webpage, and you can manipulate it to change styles, colors, or other elements dynamically

Do Dom vs Bom quiz

NOTE TO SELF: Take some time soon to organize your folders and desktop
