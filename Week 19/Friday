Went into SQL (pronounced sequel)
created sqlite3 sample.db in Projects folder using terminal
then typed this into it to create an ampty table: CREATE TABLE books (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    author TEXT NOT NULL,
    publication_year INTEGER,
    isbn TEXT UNIQUE
);

work on creating practice tables, as well as adding to them, updating entries and deleting
