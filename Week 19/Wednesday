Went into environment variables
Testing - An environment that's used to test the application to ensure that recent changes don't affect existing functionality and new features meet the project's requirements.
Staging/Development - An environment that mirrors the production environment to ensure that nothing unexpected occurs before the application is deployed to production.
Production - The environment that serves end users. For applications that need to support a large number of users, the production environment can contain multiple servers (sometimes dozens or even hundreds of servers).
